# compromises Made

1. Could not complete the assignment in 6hrs around.
2. Could have written unit tests for components
3. Used added libraries just to show my understanding around these.
4. Would be able to do better if more time in hand.
5. application is not responsive
6. State management using Normalizer not implemented and performance considerations not taken to optimum.

#Comments
1. styled-components is used for benifit of cross browser uniformity and reusability. It is more component based library for styling which gives theaming and modularity. 
2. grid-styled is used for  layout and responsiveness (though could not take care to full extent in this app ) , which is very easy flex-based library. Now it is renamed to "Rebass" with some changes, but did not use that as not aware of changes made from previous versions.
3. Redux is used for state management.
4. Redux-saga used for any side effects in the application.
5. axios is used for async calls which is small library normally used in applications. which gives tons useful funcitons for async based operations.
5. Selectors from 'reselect' are used for getting state slice from store with memoization benifits. Also used to handle construct the input to components derived from state.
